                <p id="Jordans-2-desc">Michael Jordan's second signature model, the Air Jordan 2 first debuted in November 1986, and was designed by Bruce Killgore/Peter Moore. Created with high-end luxury in mind, the AJ2 was notable for its rich leather upper, lizard skin-style detailing, and noticeable lack of a Swoosh.
